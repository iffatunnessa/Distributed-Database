Here is the structure of writting a trigger:-

CREATE [OR REPLACE] TRIGGER trigger_name - Creates or replaces an existing trigger with the trigger_name.

{BEFORE | AFTER | INSTEAD OF} - This specifies when the trigger will be executed. The INSTEAD OF clause is used for creating trigger on a view.

{INSERT [OR] | UPDATE [OR] | DELETE} - This specifies the DML operation.

[OF col_name] - This specifies the column name that will be updated.

[ON table_name] - This specifies the name of the table associated with the trigger.

[REFERENCING OLD AS o NEW AS n] - This allows you to refer new and old values for various DML statements, such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

[FOR EACH ROW] - This specifies a row-level trigger, i.e., the trigger will be executed for each row being affected. Otherwise the trigger will execute just once when the SQL statement is executed, which is called a table level trigger.

WHEN (condition) - This provides a condition for rows for which the trigger would fire. This clause is valid only for row-level triggers.
